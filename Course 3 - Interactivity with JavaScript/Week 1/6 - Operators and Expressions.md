#  6 - Operators and Expressions

---

### Statements
- We have been using statements to execute our JavaScript code
- Statements often have *expressions*
- Expressions produce values

### Expression
- So if you think back to LHS = RHS, the LHS is a variable and the RHS is what generates the value
- What are our tools for generating values on the RHS?

### Assignment Operators
- `=`
- `+`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`

### More Operators
- `++`
- `--`
- `+=`

### String Operators
- `+`
- `+=`

### Boolean Operators
- We can alsu use operators to compare values
- Assume `x = 12`;

- `==`- Is the value equal to
- `!=` - Is the value not equal to
- `>`
- `>=`
- `<`
- `<=`
- For equality with type, use `===` or `!==`

### Logical Operators
- `&&` - both sides must be true
- `||` - at least one side must be true
- `!` - not

### Review
- Programming is not just about knowing the syntax of a language
- You need to think about the logic behind what you want to do, before you start to code

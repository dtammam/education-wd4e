#  20 - Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

---

### New input types
- Fields for name, email, etc. are fairly straightforward
- Additional form fields you will want to look at include checkboxes and radio buttons

### Checkboxes
- Typically shaped as squares
- Allow the user to select options with a single click
- Options share a single name
- Reference [JS - Easy Checkboxes.html](code/JS%20-%20Easy%20Checkboxes.html)

### Radio Buttons
- Typically shaped as circles
- Just like checkboxes, radio buttons allow users an easy "click it" interface
- However, radio buttons only allow you to select one option per group
    - Reference [JS - Easy Radio Button 1.html](code/JS%20-%20Easy%20Radio%20Button%201.html)
- You can make sure that different selections work correctly by grouping things with the proper `name` attribute per group
    - Reference [JS - Easy Radio Button 2.html](code/JS%20-%20Easy%20Radio%20Button%202.html)

### JavaScript
- When using JavaScript on checkboxes and radio buttons, the boolean expression is usually on the `checked` attribute

### Review
- The purpose of forms is to allow a user an easy way to interact with the page
- Checkboxes and radio buttons are commonly used to trigger events on a page
- You can't fully implement forms unless you learn backend programming as well

#  9 - Folder Structure and Organizing Your Code

---

### Folder Structure
- Web Developers tend to organize their code into separate parts:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Images
    - JavaScript

### Conventions
- Organizing your code is a convention, not a rule

### Linking from an HTML file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

<script src="js/javaFunctions.js"></script>

<img src="images/myPicture.jpg"/>
```

### Linking from a CSS file

```css
background: url("../images/holiday.png");
```

### Debugging
- If a link isn't working you want to check a few things:
    - Did you spell the file names correctly? Case matters!
    - Are the files in the correct folder?
    - Are you working on the correct file?

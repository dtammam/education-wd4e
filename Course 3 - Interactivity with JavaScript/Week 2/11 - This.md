#  11 - This

---

### Referring to Elements
- A key to smart programming is using functions 
- A common roadblock is figuring out how to setup functions for reuse
    - How do I avoid writing a different function for every different element?
    - How can the function know which ojne I want to use?

### "this"
- "`this`" is a keyword that allows an element to reference itself
    - Every object in the DOM has an automatically generated "`this`"
- Allows you to access an element's info
    - Without "`this`" it would be difficult for the functions to know what data to use
- "`this`" is also used outside functions

### Review
- "`this`" is a tricky concept to grasp
- Repeated practice helps
- If you get stuck, work backward from where you see the keyword find the last element that was started

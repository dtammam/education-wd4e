### Putting It into Practice
- Given the HTML code and the CSS code, can you:
    - change the background-image of an element?
    - change the content of an element?

### background-image
- The background-image is an option for including graphics without using the img tag
- You should set a background-color as well in case the url isn't valid

```css
background-image: url("mypPic.jpg");
background-color: #CCEECC;
```

### Element text
- We have discussed two differentw ays to change the content
    - document.write()
    - innerHTML

### Tips
- The code we need to write is really short (less than 5/6 lines)
- You will need to think about how to incorporate the quotes
- Remember, you need to use `+` to concatenate Strings

# 2 - What is Responsive Design

---

### What is Responsive Web Design?
- It is designing your sites with multiple screen sizes/resolutions in mind
- Sites should "work" on any platform, any browser size, any orientation. The user should have the power.

### Adapting to user needs and device capabilities
- A small screen should NOT mean less content.
- People are doing more on their phones than ever before
    - Watching videos
    - Filling out applications
    - Coding
    - More use-cases will come
- Never assume the user won't need access to a specific functionality

### Concepts to consider
- Media queries - detecting the viewport size
- Flexible grid-based layout for relative sizing
- Flexible images

# 13 - Getting Started with Twitter Bootstrap

---

### Getting Started
- How do you actually use Bootstrap?
- You need access to the CSS code and JS code
- Options:
    - Download copy
    - Use absolute reference
    - Link on CodePen

### Saving your own copy of Bootstrap
- You can download a copy of Bootstrap at [the official website](https://getbootstrap.com)
- Use the default values or select [customized options](http://getbootstrap.com/customize)
- Make sure you know where you saved your files

### Using a CDN
- A CDN is a content delivery network
- Provides a way to connect to the Bootstrap code using an absolute reference
- Look at it in the [getting started guide](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started)

### Using Bootstrap with CodePen
- You can use Bootstrap to CodePen in the Settings
- Select Settings -> CSS -> Add External CSS

### Template
- It is common to start with a [template file](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples)
- A modified version from bootstrap can be found in the code directory

### How do you know it is working?
- For such a simple file, it may be hard at first to see if it is working
- To test:
    - Comment out the link to the CSS URL
    - Use Inspect Element
        - This method is definitely preferred, particularly as you start to add your own styles

### Don't forget...
- To use element inspector
- To include the JavaScript at the bottom
- That you can customize bootstrap defaults
- That you can overwrite bootstrap defaults

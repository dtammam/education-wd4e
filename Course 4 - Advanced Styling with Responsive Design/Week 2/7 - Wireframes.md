# 7 - Wireframes

---

### Wireframes
- I have done a bad, bad thing...
- This lecture should have come earlier in the course because your layout is one of the first things you should think about.
- Wireframes provide a visual representation of your layout.

### Decide on major content
- What content (including graphical) do you NEED to have on the page?
- What is the best layout for this material?

### Mobile view
- The most important step in web design is the *design*.
- You need a clear picture of what you want to create, before you can begin coding.

### Functionality
- The design should be about more than layout.
- It is possible to test the interaction as well (navigation, form inputs, etc.)

### Sketches vs Wireframes
- I recommend starting with a sketch...
- Once you have initial feedback, move to wireframe

### Some best practices
1. Don't use color (if you do, use it intentionally)
2. Consistency is key
3. Use actual content
4. Never wire alone
5. Communicate functionalities and interactions statically
6. Set clear expectations

### Review
- When you are a beginner, coming up with a design plan can be more difficult, because you don't have a client to give you feedback.
- Another challenge is keeping things simple/changeable
- If you would like to focus on design, it is still important to understand the basics of coding

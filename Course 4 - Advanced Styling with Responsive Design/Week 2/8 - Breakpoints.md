# 8 - Breakpoints

---

### Breakpoints
- What are they?
- Sizes that define a change in your site layout or content
- Used to provide the best possible experience for users based on the device information we have

### What does "trigger" mean?
- People may use the phrase "breakpoints trigger changes".
- To be honest, most people don't resize their window.
- So I will use breakpoints to refer to which rules are applied.

### Determining the Breakpoints
- Breakpoints should respond to:
    - devices and/or
    - content

### Screen sizes
- iPhone 4 (320px, 480px)
- iPhone 5 (320px, 480px)
- iPhone 6 (375px, 667px)
- iPhone 6+ (414px, 736px)
- iPhone 12 Pro (390px, 844px)
- iPhone 14 Pro Max (430px, 932px)
- Galaxy S3/S4 (320px, 640px)
- Galaxy S5 (360px, 640px)


### Mobile first
- What does this mean?
    - You'll never see a breakpoint of 320-360 pixels (small screens).
    - The default styling already covers that.
    - You should have min-width instead of max-width

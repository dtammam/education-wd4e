### Prelude
- Due to the course being designed in 2016, the majority of the notes below are moot
- Taking them for posterity

### Bootstrap 4
- I covered Bootstrap 3 in these slides, but Bootstrap 4 is now available. Does that matter?
- Well, Bootstrap 3 killed Bootstrap 2 - too many incompatible changes
- Bootstrap 4 is meant to be friendlier

### Changes
- Bootstrap 4 wil be faster (switched from Less to Sass)
- New grid tier
- New customization options
- Moved to `rem` and `em` units

### How can I find out more?
- New code can be downloaded [on the official website](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) 
- Updates can be found on [this blog](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/12/08/bootstrap-4-alpha-2/)

### What should I do?
- Get familiar with Bootstrap 3. that is still where most of the templates are, as well as code you may see in "real life"
- Consider jumping into Bootstrap 4 if you want to be a serious developer, it could be a resume builder
